# Chrome Bookmark Searcher

This chrome extension helps you to search your bookmarks not only by
tilte and url, but also by content.

So if you bookmarked something and your phrase is not in the title,
this plugin will fetch the content of your bookmark and check if your
phrase is there.

## How to install

In your Chrome browser, go to chrome://extensions and drag and drop the bookmark-searcher.crx file
into the extensions page. This will add a Bookmark Searcher icon to
Chrome's toolbar.
